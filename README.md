If I've taken it down, how to run it:
1) clone it
2) cd into the folder
3) host it on heroku (repo includes all the required files for heroku)
4) or if you wanna run it locally, run a mongodb server locally and change the link for mongoose.connect function and run "npm install" and "npx nodemon app.js".
